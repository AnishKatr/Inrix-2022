# Inrix-2022
This was out submission for Inric 2022 Hackathon @ Santa Clara University
The challenge of this project was to create a new usage, using access to the INRIX Api's
So what we decided was to create a way using public traffic data regarding p ublic buses, along with the Inrix Public transit Api, to
essentially create hot spots of where bus routs can be either modified , added, or removed so that public transit agencies can figure out 
where they can make optimizations
